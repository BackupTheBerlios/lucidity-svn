LClipboard is the module of Lucidity that takes care of holding a permanent clipboard where the user may store any object which he can later retrieve at any point.

Again, a small piece of code, very simple, I don't want to implement very complex things at this point. No comments yet, just use the source Luke, I'll write the comments (with examples included) before releasing 0.0.1

No installer yet, just copy to your ruby file path
