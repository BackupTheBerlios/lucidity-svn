Milestone0 0.0.1 is finally here.

It is distributed as a ruby gem. You can retrieve it by hand or using the installer.

If you download it by hand you also need to get splitvt sources and use the splitvt patches you can find on the Lucidity website in the download repository.

If you use the milestone0 all of this will be done automatically, including fetching all the dependencies (lconf, lobject, lclipboard) and install them.

Milestone0 is a local chat application, multiple instances of the main program (called 'm0') can be started and used to communicate.

All instances of the program must be started by the same user. Thus its usability as an actual chat application equals 0. Like i said, milestone0 just serves as a testbed for Lucidity features (and bugs ;) )

Once you open it you're presnted with something that looks like a lot of console IRC clients (e.g. epic4). Here are the commands milestone 0 accepts:

/me [arguments] 	: similar to what it does on IRC
/who			: tells you which users are online
/nick <new nick>	: changes your nickname
/quit [message]		: quits (with an optional message]
/list			: list the contents of the clipboard
/paste <id>		: paste one of the strings in the clipboard
/copy <test>		: copies some text to the clipboard
/copy_last		: copies the last message to the clipboard

I know it shows an ugly message everytime you quit. It happens because I use splitvt and /quit send a kill message to the parent PID. It could be done in some clean way, I'm sure, but I didn't bother.

PLEASE don't send me to many bug reports about milestone0. I'd prefer to only see bug reports (and feature requests and whatever) for lconf, lobject and lclipboard.

Have fun using this program and be good ;)
