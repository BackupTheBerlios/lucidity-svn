lclipboard is the module of Lucidity that takes care of holding a permanent clipboard where the user may store any object which he can later retrieve at any point.

It is now distributed as a rubygem with documentation and examples and a test suite (which also serves as a set of good examples).

You can either retrieve it and install it by hand or use the Milestone 0 installer to retrieve it automatically along with everything else that constitutes Milestone 0
