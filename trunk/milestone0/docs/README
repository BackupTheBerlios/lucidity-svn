At this point milestone 0 is just preliminary. A lot of stuff to fix, a lot of stuff to add.

You need a version of splitvt with an option called '-bottom'. At this point I have written a patch implementing this option and sent it to Sam Lantinga (the author of splitvt) and he has agreed to add it to the splitvt source. For now the patch can be found in the splitvt_patch dir, but this will be removed when Sam Lantinga releases a new version of splitvt.

So for now, you need to get the splitvt source package (http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/projects/splitvt/ and add the patches in splitvt_patch/ like this:
patch -p0 <diff file>

Then you need to:
* Copy the executable scripts in src/ anywhere in your BIN path.
* Copy the milestone0 directory in src anywhere in your ruby library path
