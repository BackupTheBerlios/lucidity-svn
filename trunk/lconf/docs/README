lconf is the part of Lucidity that handles configuration storage and retrieval.
It uses YAML as markup and can, thus, hold (almost) any object as an option in a file.

lconf is now distributed as a Ruby Gem. If you want to see documentation (with plenty of examples given) see the rdoc generated documentation in /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.x/doc where 1.x is your version of ruby.

Please see the test suite for more examples

To install it you can either retrieve the gem yourself and install it or use the (soon to come) CLI installer provided with Lucidity milestone0.
