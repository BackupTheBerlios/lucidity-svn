LConf is the part of Lucidity that handles configuration storage and retrieval.
It uses plain text files to store configuration options. That means each option you store will be a string when you retrieve it. That means you might have to call its to_i (or whatever else) method to convert the option back to your desired type.

Here is a simple example. More examples can be found in the source. As Obi Wan Kenobi would put it: "Use the source, Luke!" ;)

# you need this first
require 'lconf'
# create a new config. 
cfg=Config.new('foo')

# Create a new group as a child of cfg)
grp=Group.new(cfg,'bau')

# Create a new option as a child of opt
opt=Option.new(grp,'test','some value here')

# Search for an option with a Regexp. You can also search 
# for a Group like this with cfg.searchGroup. 
# You can then iterate through results
cfg.searchOption(/tes/) { |x| puts x.value }

# Delete an option. Groups can be deleted as well, and they will be deleted
# recursively
opt.delete!

To install just copy all files in src to your ruby lib directory (e.g. /usr/lib/ruby-1.8/
