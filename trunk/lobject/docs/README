lobject is the part of Lucidity that takes care of letting one application have acces to another application's objects. It uses UNIX sockets for communication and the DRuby module for doing all the things I couldn't possibly program ;)

Please see the examples/ directory for a sample client and server. Milestone 0 is, however, a far better example of what can be done using this technology

lobject is now distributed as a Ruby Gem. You can either retrieve it yourself and install it, or just use the Milestone0 installer to get it.

There's some decent documentation, automatically genereated with rdoc.
	1. run 'gem environment'
	2. go to the reported 'INSTALLATION DIRECTORY' in the doc subdirectory
